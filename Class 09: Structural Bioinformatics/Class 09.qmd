# 1. Introduction to RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

First, we need to read the data using the command `read.csv`:

```{r}
read.csv('Data Export Summary.csv')
PDB.data <- read.csv('Data Export Summary.csv', row.names = 1)
```

**Q1**. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

I need to sum all the elements of the X.ray column, but R does not read the values as numbers since they have commas.

```{r}
#with commas, R does not understand that these are numbers 
PDB.data$X.ray
```

In order to remove the commas, we will use the `gsub` function. We also need to read the numbers as a numeric using the `as.numeric()` function

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(',', '', PDB.data$X.ray))

```

Now, we can take the sum:

```{r}
n.Xray <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(',', '', PDB.data$X.ray)))

n.EM <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(',', '', PDB.data$EM)))

n.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(',', '', PDB.data$Total)))

p_xray_em <- ((n.Xray + n.EM)/ n.total) *100

p_xray_em
```

#### The answer is 93 percent.

**Q2:** What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
n.proteins <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(',', '', PDB.data[1,7])))
n.proteins

prop_proteins <- n.proteins/n.total

prop_proteins
```

#### 0.868

**Q3:** Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

#### We found 2,003 protease structures in the current PDB, but it was difficult to find the actual number of structures.

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 Protease Structure

**Q4**: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

#### It simplifies it to one atom. If you hover over a water molecule, it says it is an O atom. It only shows the main molecule to avoid complexity and allow the structure to be viewed more easily in a more organized way.

**Q5**: There is a critical "conserved" water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

#### HOH 308

**Q6**: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend *"Ball & Stick"* for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

**Discussion Topic:** Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

**Q7.** How many animal acid residues are there in this pdb object?

#### There are 198 residues

**Q8.** Name one of the two non-protein residues.

#### HOH and MK1

**Q9.** How many protein chains are in this structure?

#### There are two protein chains

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

## Predicting Function Motions of a Single Structure by NMA

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb('6s36')
```

```{r}
adk
```

Now, we will perform normal mode analysis (NMA) to predict protein flexibility and potential functional motions

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
#fluctuations are the amounts of flexibility 
#corresponding to particular amino acids. 
```

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "adk_m7.pdb")
```
